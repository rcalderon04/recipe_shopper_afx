# Privacy Policy for Recipe to Shopping List

**Last Updated:** December 10, 2025

## 1. Introduction
"Recipe to Shopping List" ("we", "our", or "the Extension") is a browser extension designed to help users parse recipes and create shopping lists on Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it.

## 2. Data Collection
We **do not** collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data, browsing history, or recipe information to our own servers.

- **Client-Side Processing**: All recipe parsing happens locally on your device within your browser.
- **No Analytics**: We do not use third-party analytics services to track your usage.
- **No Accounts**: You do not need to create an account with us to use the Extension.

## 3. Data Usage
The Extension interacts with third-party services only at your explicit request:

- **Amazon/Whole Foods**: When you click "Add to Cart", the Extension constructs a shopping list and sends it directly to Amazon's AFX API (`https://www.amazon.com/afx/ingredients/landing`) via your browser. This interaction is subject to Amazon's own privacy policy.

## 4. Permissions
The Extension requests the minimum permissions necessary to function:
- **activeTab / scripting**: To read the recipe text on the page you are currently viewing when you open the extension.
- **storage**: To save your preference for "Whole Foods" vs. "Amazon Fresh" locally on your device.

## 5. Contact
If you have questions about this policy, please contact us via the Chrome Web Store support tab.
